        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are among the universe's most energetic phenomena, with their intense relativistic jets powered by central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). These jets inject vast amounts of energy into surrounding interstellar and intergalactic spaces, impacting gas movement, influencing star formation, and driving the evolution of galaxy clusters. Our CAPIBARA mission is dedicated to detecting both cosmic rays (CRs) and high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray emissions, aiming to offer new insights into these extreme processes and their effects on cosmic environments.

        <h2>Our Research Focus</h2>
        Our research is focused on understanding the influence of AGN jets on star formation and cosmic ray production. This area of astrophysics remains complex and critical, as AGN-driven processes likely play a role in both quenching star formation and generating cosmic rays. The CAPIBARA mission will compare its high-energy particle and photon data with SWIFT-based simulations of AGN jets, analyzing how these jets impact cosmic ray populations and contribute to the high-energy photon background across the universe. This work aligns with CAPIBARA's objective to advance our understanding of high-energy cosmic events.

        <h2>Focus</h2>  
        Our primary goal is to assess how AGN jets interact with their environments, especially in the context of cosmic ray production and high-energy emissions. By modeling jet power, spin dynamics, and interactions with surrounding gases, we can deepen our understanding of the processes involved. CAPIBARA’s observational data will help validate these models, offering unique observational data that informs and enhances the astrophysical simulations we use.

        <h2>Methods and Tools</h2>
        We employ the SWIFT simulation code to recreate AGN jet phenomena, following methodologies similar to those by Huško et al., which involve jet feedback and black hole spin dynamics in galaxy groups and clusters. Through SWIFT, we model the power and dynamics of AGN jets and their effects on the surrounding interstellar medium. By comparing these simulations with CAPIBARA’s observations, we aim to clarify the relationship between AGN feedback, cosmic ray production, and galaxy cluster evolution.

        <h2>Authors</h2>
        The CAPIBARA team comprises a diverse group of high school researchers dedicated to exploring high-energy astrophysics through innovative observational and theoretical approaches. Under the guidance of academic advisors and in collaboration with research institutions, we work to push the boundaries of what student-led science can achieve in cosmic ray and high-energy photon research.
