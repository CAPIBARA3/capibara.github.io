        <h2>What are GRB? And why are they important?</h2>
        <p>The Hubble constant in the expansion rate of the Universe and a key value for cosmology, the study of the Universe as whole. However, there is a diverging discrepancy between different methods to compute this value.</p>
        <p>Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most energetic explosions in the Universe, and they can be observed at great cosmological distances. In just a few seconds, GRBs release more energy than the Sun emits over its entire lifetime.</p>
        <p>We aim to standardize GRBs as distance indicators, expanding the method of the distance ladder and providing new tools for cosmology. Not only will this help refine the Hubble constant, but it will also allow for more precise fitting of cosmological models, leading to a better understanding of other fundamental parameters of the Universe.</p>

        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>Our research focuses on leveraging GRBs as "cosmic beacons" to measure comsological distances and better understand the origin and evolution of the Universe. We aim to introduce a further powerful standard candle to the distance ladder method, which is capable of reaching much greater distances.</p>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <p>We rely on the ùõæ-ray detector on our satellite to detect Gamma-Ray Bursts using a wide field of view. The afterglow of GRBs will be then detected with our more accurate X-ray detector, combining these observations with data from ground-based telescopes we will measure key parameters to measure model-independent distances to the bursts. Having model-independent distance measurements, we can use redshift to measure the Hubble constant.</p>
